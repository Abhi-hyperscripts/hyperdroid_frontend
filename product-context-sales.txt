HRMS — HR MANAGEMENT & PAYROLL
--------------------------------
THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR: Ragenaizer is the ONLY HRMS that shows exactly how every payslip number was calculated. 57 auditable fields per payslip. Click any line and see the exact formula, inputs, and values. 100% transparent, 100% audit-ready.

PAYROLL:
- Country-agnostic engine — works in India, USA, UK, UAE, any country via JSON config
- Automated statutory compliance — auto-calculates PF, ESI, PT, TDS, retirement, insurance, taxes
- Multi-location support — mid-month transfers with split calculations
- Retrospective arrears — handles salary revisions, arrears-on-arrears
- Draft preview before finalization
- Flat-rate pricing (not per-employee like greytHR's ₹50/employee/month)

ATTENDANCE:
- Geofenced clock-in (location-based)
- NFC kiosk / biometric integration
- Regularization workflows
- Overtime tracking

LEAVE MANAGEMENT:
- Unlimited configurable leave types
- Carry-forward and accruals
- Manager/HR approval workflows
- Real-time balance tracking

EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT:

LOANS & ADVANCES:

- TDS Old/New regime support
- Extends to any country's statutory requirements

WHY NOT greytHR:
- Calculation proofs (greytHR doesn't show how numbers are calculated)
- Unified platform (greytHR = HR only, no video/chat/storage)
- Country-agnostic (greytHR = India/UAE/KSA only)
- Self-hosted option available
- No per-employee pricing

WHY NOT ENTERPRISE HRMS (Oracle, Workday, SAP):
- Setup: 1 day vs 8-12 months
- Implementation cost: $0 vs $500K+
- Minimum size: 1 employee vs 500+
- No dedicated IT team needed
- No feature bloat (70% unused features in enterprise tools)
- Month-to-month vs multi-year lock-in

STRESS TEST PROOF:
- 3 retroactive salary revisions in same period
- Mid-month office transfer (Day 15)
- Statutory ceiling change mid-period
- ALL tests passed — arrears collapse, location split, statutory ceilings, tax jurisdictions handled correctly

SALES OBJECTION HANDLING
--------------------------

"We already use Zoom/Slack/etc."
→ You're paying ~$40/user/mo for 4 tools that don't talk to each other. Ragenaizer = $12/user/mo for everything integrated. That's $33,600/year savings for 100 employees.

"Is the video quality as good as Zoom?"
→ Yes. Built on LiveKit (same WebRTC standard as Zoom). HD adaptive quality, 100+ participants, unlimited duration. Plus you get chat, storage, and HR included.

"We need enterprise-grade HR/payroll."
→ Our payroll engine passed a stress test with 3 retroactive salary revisions + mid-month transfer + statutory changes — all in one period. We show 57 auditable fields per payslip. No enterprise HRMS does that.

"Can it work in our country?"
→ Yes. Country-agnostic payroll engine with JSON-configurable statutory rules. Works in India, USA, UK, UAE, and any other country.

"What about data security?"
→ AES-256 encryption, JWT auth, self-hosted option available. Your data never leaves your control. No third-party data sharing.

"We're a small team, is this overkill?"
→ No minimum size. Works for 1 employee to 10,000+. You pay per user, and everything is included. No feature bloat — use what you need.

"What about migration from our current tools?"
→ We handle migration support. Chat history, files, employee data — we help you move everything over. 1-day setup typical.

"Why haven't I heard of you?"
→ We're focused on product quality over marketing. Our HRMS calculation transparency is something no competitor offers — not even the billion-dollar players. Ask any of them to show you how a payslip number was calculated.
